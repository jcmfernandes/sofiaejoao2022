        <p>Firstly, we want to thank you for your presence on this important day. It means a lot to us.</p>

<p>As you know, the bride and groom come from different backgrounds. While Sofia is Slovak and has a Hungarian nationality, João is Portuguese. These differences are reflected within this day, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wedding ceremony will be multilingual: you will hear a mix of Slovak, Portuguese, and English;</li>
  <li>We will sing, dance, and celebrate in traditional Slovak, Portuguese, and Hungarian ways;</li>
  <li>We will serve you Slovak, as well as Portuguese wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to participate in all these moments, and most importantly, we hope you will have a lot of fun!</p>

<h3 id="first-reading">First Reading</h3>

<p><em>Read in Slovak.</em></p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Book of Tobit 8, 4–8:</strong></p>

<p><sup>4</sup>When Sarah’s parents left the bedroom and closed the door behind them, Tobiah rose from bed and said to his wife, “My sister, come, let us pray and beg our Lord to grant us mercy and protection.” <sup>5</sup>She got up, and they started to pray and beg that they might be protected. He began with these words:</p>

<p>“Blessed are you, O God of our ancestors; blessed be your name forever and ever!
Let the heavens and all your creation bless you forever.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>You made Adam, and you made his wife Eve to be his helper and support; and from these two the human race has come.
You said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone; let us make him a helper like himself.’</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Now, not with lust, but with fidelity I take this kinswoman as my wife.
Send down your mercy on me and on her, and grant that we may grow old together.
Bless us with children.”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>They said together, “Amen, amen!”</p>

<h3 id="responsorial-psaml">Responsorial Psaml</h3>

<p><em>Read in Portuguese.</em></p>

<p><strong>Psalm 114:</strong></p>

<p><em>Chorus:</em> The Lord is good to all creatures.</p>

<p>The Lord is gracious and merciful,<br />
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.<br />
The Lord is good to all,<br />
and his compassion is over all that he has made.</p>

<p>All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord,<br />
and all your faithful shall bless you.<br />
The eyes of all look to you,<br />
and you give them their food in due season.</p>

<p>The Lord is just in all his ways,<br />
and kind in all his doings.<br />
The Lord is near to all who call on him,<br />
to all who call on him in truth.</p>

<h3 id="second-reading">Second Reading</h3>

<p><em>Read in Slovak.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3, 12–17:</strong></p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, <sup>13</sup>bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do. <sup>14</sup>And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection. <sup>15</sup>And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. And be thankful.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. <sup>17</sup>And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>

<h3 id="gospel">Gospel</h3>

<p><em>Read in Portuguese.</em></p>

<p><strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew 18, 21–35:</strong></p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, if another member of the
church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven
times?” <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. <sup>24</sup>When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; <sup>25</sup>and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. <sup>26</sup>So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ <sup>27</sup>And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. <sup>28</sup>But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’ <sup>29</sup>Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ <sup>30</sup>But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. <sup>32</sup>Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. <sup>33</sup>Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’ <sup>34</sup>And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup>So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”</p>
